## _Introduction_
This is my attempt to automatize basic setup actions I do in most of my projects.
Feel free to use it and add any templates you want. If you do, pls do not forget to
create a pull request to improve existing solution

## _Setting up_
To set PyWebTmp up run **fish start.fish**
This script copies templates to .dev_utils directory at home/user/
and copies setup.fish to ~/.config/fish/functions/

### _Warnings_
I consider you already have fish as you shell.
If not, run pacman -S fish or alternatives and set fish up
